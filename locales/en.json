The distribution shown here can help you determine the optimal timing for sending review request emails to maximize response rates. It also provides context for interpreting the content of reviews based on when they were submitted relative to the purchase date.",

        "mixed": "Your rating distribution shows a mixed reception, with ratings spread across the spectrum. This suggests inconsistent experiences among your customers, which could be due to product variability, service inconsistency, or different customer expectations.",
